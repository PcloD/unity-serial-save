A simple save file solution for your Unity games, which will work on all platforms that support local file storage. It uses binary serialization for simplicity and also to hide the saved values from your users without needing encryption. Any class which is serializable is supported, however, to avoid problems with versioning you may wish to just stick with the primitive types.
